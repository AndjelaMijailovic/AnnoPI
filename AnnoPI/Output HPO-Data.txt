In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps. Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal.

Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck.

HP:0002063 | Rigidity |Continuous involuntary sustained muscle contraction. When an affected muscle is passively stretched, the degree of resistance remains constant regardless of the rate at which the muscle is stretched. This feature helps to distinguish rigidity from muscle spasticity.
HP:0002172 | Postural instability |A tendency to fall or the inability to keep oneself from falling; imbalance. The retropulsion test is widely regarded as the gold standard to evaluate postural instability, Use of the retropulsion test includes a rapid balance perturbation in the backward direction, and the number of balance correcting steps (or total absence thereof) is used to rate the degree of postural instability. Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps. Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal. Markedly affected patients continue to step backward without ever regaining their balance and must be caught by the examiner (this would be called true retropulsion). Even more severely affected patients fail to correct entirely, and fall backward like a pushed toy soldier, without taking any corrective steps.

Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type.

HP:0032980 | Absent |Significantly decreased level or failed detection of surfactant protein C in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. Comment: Pulmonary surfactant is a highly surface-active mixture of proteins and lipids that is synthesized and secreted onto the alveoli by type II epithelial cells. The protein part of surfactant constitutes of four types of surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant metabolism and have immunologic functions, whereas SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic molecules, which play a direct role in the organization of the surfactant structure in the interphase and in the stabilization of the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle. Lack of SP-C may result of surfactant metabolism dysfunction and is also observed in patients with other diffuse parenchymal lung diseaes, pathogenetically related to the alveolar surfactant region.

HP:0032177 | Parenchymal |Consolidation refers to an exudate or other product of disease that replaces alveolar air, rendering the lung solid (as in infective pneumonia).
HP:0030874 | Oxygen |Oxygen saturation less than 95% on exertion or arterial partial pressure of oxygen falling by more than 1kPa.
HP:0012590 | Abnormal |An abnormal amount of urine production.
HP:0031265 | Abnormal |Any structural anomaly of the podocyte, which is a highly specialized cell of the Bowman capsule and which forms multiple interdigitating foot processes. Podocytes are interconnected by slit diaphragms and cover the exterior basement membrane surface of the glomerular capillary.
HP:0031504 | Foamy |Urine has an increased amount of frothy fine bubbles.
HP:4000041 | AA |Extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils that are composed of fragments of and/or intact serum amyloid A protein, a hepatic acute phase reactant.
HP:0040167 | Facial |
HP:0031208 | Increased |An increased concentration of circulating alpha polypeptide of glycoprotein hormones (NCBI Gene 1081). This alpha subunit is common to luteinizing hormone (LH) , follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) , thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which are glycoprotein hormones composed of an identical alpha subunit together with a beta subunit that confers biological specificity. The alpha subunit is used as a marker for tumors that produce these hormones.
HP:0025429 | Abnormal |Any anomaly of the vocalizing of an infant's crying, i.e.,the typically loud voice production that is accompanied by tears and agitation.
HP:0011789 | Impaired |Reduced sensitivity of thyroid follicle cells to stimulation by biologically active thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
HP:0033177 | Elevated |An increased concentration of suberic acid in the blood circulation. Suberic acid is an alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acid that is the 1,6-dicarboxy derivative of hexane.
HP:0033504 | Elevated |An increased concentration of fumarate, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, in the blood circulation.
HP:0033325 | Elevated |Increased concentration of sebacic acid in the blood circulation.
HP:0032999 | Increased |Abnormally high concentration of fecal porphyrins in feces.
HP:0005667 | Os |Separation of the odontoid process from the body of the axis.
HP:0033851 | Oculomotor |Elevation of the upper eyelid on attempted downward gaze or adduction, adduction of the eye on attempted upward or downward gaze, and constriction of the pupil on attempted adduction.
HP:0001435 | Abnormality |
HP:0031331 | Abnormal |Any structural anomaly of cardiomyocytes, which are terminally differentiated muscle cells in the heart that are interconnected end to end by gap junctions, which allows coordinated contraction of heart tissue.
HP:0031684 | Renal |An atherosclerotic lesion located in the renal artery.
HP:0025437 | Macrocephalic |Increased size of the head of sperm.
HP:0033980 | Paroxysmal |Recurrent episodes of sustained upward deviation of the eyes and incomplete downward saccades, and normal horizontal eye movements without impairment of consciousness.
